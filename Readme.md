Description
A player rolls a die repeatedly on each turn until they decide to "hold" or they roll a 1:

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and lose their turn,
If they roll any other number, it is added to their turn total and their turn continues,
If they choose to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and pass on their turn.
